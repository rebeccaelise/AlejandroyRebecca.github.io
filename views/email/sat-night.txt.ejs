That was amazing. Thank you so much for being here with us this weekend, it
means so much to have had you here. We hope you travel home safe.

We will be recovering and getting brunch at King's Highway (in the front of the
hotel) in the morning if you would like to come find us to say goodbye.

So many great pictures are already up on the #hellohurons hashtag. If you took
any great ones and want to share them on Facebook or Instagram, please tag them
so we can find them.

With Love,
Lee + Ash
