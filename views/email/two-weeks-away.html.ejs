with calm and enjoy your stay.</p>

<p><b>Friday:</b></p>

The Commune next to the smaller pool on the far side of the hotel grounds.

<p><b>Saturday:</b></p>

<p>The Pool Party starts at the Swim Club Pool (the larger pool at the hotel) at
10am. If you're coming, please show up before noon as the pool opens to the
public and they may not let people in after they reach capacity. We also have
more space to stretch out in and play some games. We'll be serving lunch and
if you're still hungry or want a drink the Ace has a poolside menu.</p>

<p>Please arrive for our ceremony at The Commune at 6pm Saturday evening.
We'll keep it short and sweet so we can move on to the party. Dress festive
and fun (tie optional). We'll keep the food and drink coming.</p>

<p><b>Weather:</b></p>

<p>Expect bright sun and high temperatures in the 90s during the day, so
dress light if you're exploring. In the evenings the temperature drops
into the low 60s. As our Friday dinner and Saturday celebrations will go
into the night, you might want to have a jacket to keep warm. California is
having its rainiest year on record. Despite being in the desert we may see
a few light showers.</p>
