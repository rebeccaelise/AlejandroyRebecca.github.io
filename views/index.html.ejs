    <div class="content">

      <p>Lee's love of modern architecture and Ash's love of the desert landscape
      brings us all to one of our favorite vacation spots. We're so excited to share
      it with you. In the Coachella Valley, south of the Mojave Desert and in the
      shadow of the San Jacinto Mountains, Palm Springs is an oasis town
      that charmed the 1930's Hollywood elite and became a hotspot of post-war
      architecture in the 1950's. Beyond the city are some fantastic landscapes
      like Joshua Tree a national park larger than the state of Rhode Island named
      after the tree that inspired Dr. Seuss.</p>

      <p>Palm Springs is a fun place to explore. We hope that you get a little
      extra time to find an adventure or something tasty. We've collected a
      few suggestions of our favorite things to eat, see, and do.</p>

            <img src="/photos/places/kings-highway.jpg" />
            <h4>King's Highway</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Right in front of Ace Hotel, King's Highway is a former Denny's
          converted into a bohemian roadside diner serving California standards,
          and Stumptown coffee. Great for Breakfast or Lunch, make sure you visit
          at least once while you're here. We'll be here for Sunday brunch.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.cheekysps.com/" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/cheekys.jpg" />
            <h4>Cheeky's</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Home to one of the best Eggs Benedict in America, a fried chicken
          sandwich to die for, and for the bacon lovers: a house-cured bacon flight.
          You'll want a nap (preferably pool-side) afterwards. This place is popular
          and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.lapperts.com/" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/lapperts.jpg" />
            <h4>Lappert's</h4>
          </a>
          <p>This Hawaiian-style ice cream shop is run by the son of the famous
          Lappert's of Kauai. is a perfect excuse to cool down on a hot desert day.
          Try an avocado ice cream, a shave ice, or our favorite: a Dole Whip.
          Seriously, you haven't lived until you've had a Dole Whip.</p>

          <h3>Adventure</h3>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.pstramway.com" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/tramway.jpg" />
            <h4>Aerial Tramway</h4>
          </a>
          <p>The worlds largest rotating tram car takes you on a 2.5 mile path
          up above 8,500 feet to Mountain Station for a stunning view of the valley
          below, and miles of hiking trails. The peak is about 30 degrees colder
          than downtown Palm Springs. Buy tickets ahead of time.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.scootpalmsprings.com" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/scoot.jpg" />
            <h4>Scoot Palm Springs</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Rent a vespa-style scooter and go explore the city! Scoot Palm
          Springs works with the Ace Hotel and has a few scooters on site, so
          just head to the front desk to get set up. California residents need a
          motorcycle license, but any license will do for out-of-staters.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/joshua-tree.jpg" />
            <h4>Joshua Tree National Park</h4>
          </a>
          <p>This massive national park is where the Mojave and Colorado deserts
          meet. A wild landscape that can feel like another planet, it gets its
          name from a tree that's right out of a Dr. Seuss book. A great place
          to hike, rock climb, and camp. Plan to spend a whole day here, it takes
          over an hour to drive to either entrance.</p>

            <h4>Palm Springs Art Museum</h4>
          </a>
          <p>This museum hosts a good collection of contemporary and historic
          works, however the sculpture garden is particularly great. The
          desert-modern concrete building itself is worth the visit. Also don't
          miss the Architecture and Design center, a separate building made of
          glass with awesome views.</p>

      <h3>Desert Formal Attire</h3>

        <div>
          <h4>Ladies</h4>
          <p>
            Friday's formal dinner is our fancy night, so class up the joint in
            your favorite color. Stay cool (and <em>cool</em>) in flowy, formal
            maxi dresses. It can get cool at night, so bring a sweater, shawl,
            scarf or other&nbsp;warmth-cocoon.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Gents</h4>
          <p>
            For Friday's formal dinner, look sharp. Wear a suit and tie
            (or bowtie?) in whatever color you look best in (it doesn't have to
            be dark). A cotton or linen suit will be more comfortable than wool
            in the&nbsp;heat.
          </p>

          <h4>Ladies</h4>
          <p>
            Saturday's ceremony is party time! Wear something festive that will
            take you comfortably from an outdoor ceremony to the dance floor. It
            gets cool when the sun goes down, so plan&nbsp;accordingly.
          </p>
          <img width="485" src="/photos/wear/ladies-festive.jpg" />

        <div>
          <h4>Gents</h4>
          <p>
            For Saturday's ceremony, have fun and look good. Try a suit in a
            bright color or a fun patterned shirt. Look to your socks or pocket
            square for complimenting colors and patterns. Tie&nbsp;optional.
